# End-to-End-Sentiment-Analysis-Pipeline

You will implement a sentiment analysis pipeline on a well-known public dataset. The process includes:

1.	Downloading the dataset (already annotated with sentiment).
   
2.	Storing the data in a database.
   
3.	Cleaning and exploring the data.

4.	Training and evaluating a classification model.

5.	Serving the trained model via a Flask API (with an endpoint that predicts sentiment for new text)
