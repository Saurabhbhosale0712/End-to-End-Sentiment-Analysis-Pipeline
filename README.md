# "Movie Review Sentiment Analyzer"

### **Project Overview:**  

This project aims to classify movie reviews as **positive or negative** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning**. By leveraging **text preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, and Logistic Regression**, the model predicts sentiment based on user-input reviews. A **Flask web application** provides an interactive interface where users can enter a review and instantly receive its sentiment analysis.  

### **Project Objectives:**  

1. **Build a Sentiment Classification Model:** Train a **Logistic Regression** model using movie reviews to classify them as **positive or negative**.
    
2. **Implement Text Preprocessing:** Clean text by **removing special characters, stopwords, and HTML tags** to improve model accuracy.  

3. **Feature Extraction using TF-IDF:** Convert text into numerical representations using **TF-IDF vectorization** for better machine learning performance.  

4. **Develop a Flask Web App:** Create an interactive **Flask-based web interface** where users can input movie reviews and get real-time sentiment predictions.  

5. **Improve User Experience:** Display the **original, cleaned review, and predicted sentiment** with a user-friendly interface.

# End-to-End-Sentiment-Analysis-Pipeline

To implement a sentiment analysis pipeline on a well-known public dataset. The process includes:

1.	Downloading the dataset  (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews)
   
2.	Storing the data in a database.
   
3.	Cleaning and exploring the data.

4.	Training and evaluating a classification model.

5.	Serving the trained model via a Flask API (with an endpoint that predicts sentiment for new text)
